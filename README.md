# bowMOI
A calculator for various bow kinematics

# Initial design specs:
## Inputs
Bow mass (Riser, limbs, string, sight, dampeners)
Long rod length and mass
Side Rod length and mass
extender length and mass
v-bar angles (x axis. assume both bars are at the same angle for now)
v-bar angles (y-axis, degrees below vertical)
mass weight added to each side rod and length of mass weights
mass weight added to long rod and length of mass weights

## Outputs
MOI
Center of Mass
Total mass weight
